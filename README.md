# Wordle but Multiplayer

A wordle clone with multiplayer support (pretty scuffed right now, was literally made in 4 hours)

## TODO

- store the sessionID in the localStorage rather than the word of the other player
- add win/lose pop-up
- add a timer
- add a menu to select singleplayer/multiplayer
- customize the word length (?)

## Running

```console
$ node backend.js
```
